## Flip Coin Project Docs

This repo is only used to host and serve static assets in support of [Flip Coin Flutter Project](https://github.com/Lmanskee/flip_coin_flutter).

## URL structure

Reference the assets with this URL structure:

`https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/<library>/<asset>`

For example, an image named `app_bar.png` about `AppBar` from the material library would go in the `assets/material/` directory and be at `https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/app_bar.png`.

All asset files should be under the assets directory in an appropriate subdirectory.
