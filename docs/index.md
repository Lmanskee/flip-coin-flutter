## Coin Flip Project Docs

This repo is only used to host and serve static assets in support of [Coin Flip Flutter Project](https://github.com/Lmanskee/flip_coin_flutter).

## URL structure

Reference the assets with this URL structure:

`https://lmanskee.github.io/flip_coin_flutter/assets/<library>/<asset>`

For example, an image named `default.png` would go in the `assets/pngs/` directory and be at `https://lmanskee.github.io/flip_coin_flutter/assets/pngs/default.png`.

![Default Coin](./assets/pngs/default.png)

All asset files should be under the assets directory in an appropriate subdirectory.
