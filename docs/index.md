## Flip Coin Project Docs

This repo is only used to host and serve static assets in support of flip_coin_flutter project.

## URL structure

Reference the assets with this URL structure:

https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/<library>/<asset>

For example, an image named app_bar.png about AppBar from the material library would go in the assets/material/ directory and be at https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/app_bar.png.

All asset files should be under the assets directory in an appropriate subdirectory.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Lmanskee/flip_coin_flutter/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Lmanskee/flip_coin_flutter/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
